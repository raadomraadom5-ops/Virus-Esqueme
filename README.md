📽️ Instructions for Video Creators
If you are using these scripts for YouTube, TikTok, or tech reviews, follow these best practices:

Environment: Always run scripts inside a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox, VMware, or Windows Sandbox).

Security Settings: You may need to temporarily disable Real-Time Protection, as the infinite loop behavior might be flagged by heuristics.

How to Stop: To terminate the execution during your recording, press CTRL + SHIFT + ESC to open Task Manager and end the wscript.exe process.
